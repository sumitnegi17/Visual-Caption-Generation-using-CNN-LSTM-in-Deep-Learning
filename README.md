# Visual Caption Generation using CNN-LSTM in Deep Learning

## Overview

Deep learning is a rapidly advancing field that is transforming various aspects of our daily lives. This project explores the use of deep learning techniques, specifically Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks, to generate captions for images.

The goal is to create a model that can generate human-readable textual descriptions of images by combining the strengths of CNNs for feature extraction and LSTMs for sequence prediction.

## Project Architecture

### CNN-LSTM Model

The CNN-LSTM model is a hybrid architecture that leverages the capabilities of CNNs and LSTMs. Here's how it works:

- **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)**: These are employed to map image data to an output variable. They are highly effective for prediction tasks involving image data.
- **Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) and LSTMs**: These are designed for sequence prediction problems, such as generating a sequence of words (captions) from image data. LSTM networks, a variant of RNNs, are particularly successful in handling long-term dependencies in sequences.

#### Workflow:

1. **Feature Extraction**: A deep CNN model, pre-trained or custom-trained, is used to extract features from input images.
2. **Sequence Prediction**: The extracted features are fed into an LSTM network, which generates a sequence of words (the caption) for the input image.

This model is specifically designed for sequence prediction tasks with spatial inputs, making it ideal for tasks like image captioning.

### Image Captioning

Image captioning is the task of generating a textual description of an image. It involves two main components:

1. **Feature Extraction**: Using a CNN model to extract salient features from images.
2. **Language Model**: An LSTM-based model that generates a sequence of words (captions) from the extracted features.

## Implementation

The project is implemented in Python using the Keras library. Below are the key steps and resources involved:

### Dataset

The dataset used is the **Flickr8k** dataset, which contains 8,092 photographs with corresponding textual descriptions. The dataset is divided into:

- **Training Set**: 6,000 images
- **Development Set**: 1,000 images
- **Test Set**: 1,000 images

You can download the dataset using the following links:

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- Keras
- TensorFlow
- NumPy
- NLTK
- Matplotlib

### Code Structure

- **Feature Extraction**: The code uses a pre-trained CNN model (like VGG) to extract feature vectors from images.
- **Language Model**: An LSTM-based model is trained to generate captions from these feature vectors.

### Training

The model is trained for 20 epochs. However, you can experiment with different hyperparameters to optimize the model performance.

### Results

After training, the model generates captions for the images in the test set. Here is an example of the results obtained:

```python
# Example of generated caption
Image: sample_image.jpg
Generated Caption: "A group of people standing on a beach with surfboards."
```

### How to Run

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Visual-Caption-Generation-using-CNN-LSTM-in-Deep-Learning.git
   cd Visual-Caption-Generation-using-CNN-LSTM-in-Deep-Learning

2. Install the required dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Prepare the dataset and train the model:
   ```bash
   python train_model.py
   ```

4. Generate captions for new images:
   ```bash
   python generate_caption.py --image_path path_to_image.jpg
   ```
